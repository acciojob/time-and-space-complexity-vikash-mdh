    <!-- First Paragraph: Time Complexity -->
    <p>
      Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of 
      time it takes to run an algorithm. It is an important concept for analyzing how 
      <strong>efficient</strong> an algorithm is in terms of execution time as the input size grows.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph: Space Complexity -->
    <p>
      <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm uses 
      relative to the input size. It helps determine how efficiently the algorithm utilizes memory, 
      and it is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as <code>O(n)</code>.
